# Banking CLI Application

A comprehensive command-line banking application built in C++, designed to provide users with basic banking functionalities. It builds on top of a previous banking CLI application offering improvements to the original functionality. It supports customer and administrative interactions, account management, and transaction processing. This application uses data structures like linked lists and binary search trees to ensure efficient operations and introduces a user-friendly interface enhanced by the FTXUI library for dynamic and visually appealing outputs.
